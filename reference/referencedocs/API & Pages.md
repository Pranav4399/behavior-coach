## Closing Notes

- **Security**: All endpoints should be protected with proper authentication (JWT or session tokens), role-based authorization, and tenant-based data filtering.  
- **Pagination & Filtering**: For high-volume data (workers, segments, experiments), endpoints should accept query parameters (e.g., `?page=2&limit=50`, `?search=keyword`, `?sortBy=created_at`).
- **Error Handling**: Responses should follow a standardized format (e.g., JSON with `error.code` and `error.message` fields).
- **Webhooks**: Depending on WhatsApp or external integrations, additional webhook endpoints may be required (e.g., `/webhooks/whatsapp`).

This combined front-end page outline plus back-end endpoint listing provides a comprehensive map of the features your Behavioral Coaching Platform will need. It can serve as the foundation for your development sprints, API documentation, and integration strategies. By agreeing on these endpoints early, the front-end team can confidently structure their calls and workflows, while the back-end team knows exactly what business logic to expose.
