Key Architectural Components

1. UI Layer: Next.js-based frontend providing role-specific interfaces for different user types
2. API Layer: RESTful API endpoints organized by domain, with standardized request/response formats
3. Application Layer: Core business logic encapsulated in domain services and use cases
4. Domain Layer: Rich domain models representing core business concepts (Journeys, Programs, etc.)
5. Infrastructure Layer: Database access, external integrations, and cross-cutting concerns

This layered architecture implements Clean Architecture principles, ensuring that core domain logic remains isolated from infrastructure concerns.

Modular Monolith Architecture

The Behavioral Coaching Platform is architected as a modular monolith, which offers several advantages for the current stage of development while providing a clear path for future evolution.

Why Modular Monolith?

- Development Velocity: Faster development cycles without the complexity of microservices
- Operational Simplicity: Easier deployment, monitoring, and troubleshooting
- Team Coordination: Better coordination for a platform with highly interconnected domains
- Future Flexibility: Well-defined domain boundaries enable extraction to microservices if needed later
- Deployment Simplicity: Single deployment unit reduces operational overhead

Module Organization

The codebase is organized by domain first, with clear boundaries between different functional areas:

```

├── config/                # Application configuration
├── lib/                   # Shared libraries and utilities
├── middleware/            # Global middleware

    └── experiments/       # Experiments domain
```

### Module Coupling and Cohesion

Each domain module is designed with:

- High Internal Cohesion: Related functionality grouped together
- Low External Coupling: Dependencies between domains managed through explicit interfaces
- Clear API Boundaries: Each domain exposes a well-defined API to other domains
- Independent Deployability: Modules could be extracted to separate services if needed
- Autonomous Development: Domain teams can work relatively independently

### Domain Interaction Patterns

Domains interact with each other through:

1. Explicit Interfaces: Formal contracts defined between domains
2. Domain Events: Event-driven communication for cross-domain notifications
3. Shared Kernel: Minimal shared models for concepts used across domains
4. Repository Access: Limited direct data access with strict permission controls

## Domain-Driven Design Implementation

The Behavioral Coaching Platform implements Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles to create a rich, expressive model of the behavioral coaching domain.

### Strategic Design Elements

1. Bounded Contexts: Clear boundaries between domains with different conceptual models
   - Journey Context: Focuses on content design and structure
   - Program Context: Focuses on operational execution and audience management
   - Experiment Context: Spans multiple contexts to enable systematic testing

2. Context Mapping: Explicit relationships between bounded contexts
   - Customer/Supplier: Marketplace → Content domain relationship
   - Conformist: External integrations (WhatsApp) relationship
   - Partnership: Program ↔ Journey relationship
   - Separate Ways: Analytics has its own models of other domains

3. Ubiquitous Language: Consistent terminology across code, documentation, and user interfaces
   - Examples: "Journey Blueprints," "Touchpoints," "Program Execution," "Segments"

### Tactical Design Patterns

1. Aggregates: Consistency boundaries for related entities
   - Journey Blueprint Aggregate: Blueprint with Phases, Touchpoints, and Rules
   - Program Aggregate: Program with Timeline, Worker Assignments, and Progress Tracking
   - Experiment Aggregate: Experiment with Variants and Assignments

2. Entities: Objects with identity and lifecycle
   - Worker, Organization, Journey, Program, Content, Experiment

3. Value Objects: Immutable objects representing concepts without identity
   - SegmentRule, Touchpoint, ContentVariant, ExperimentMetric

4. Domain Services: Stateless operations on multiple entities
   - SegmentMembershipService, JourneyRuleEvaluationService, ExperimentAssignmentService

5. Domain Events: Notifications of significant occurrences in the domain
   - WorkerSegmentChanged, JourneyCompleted, ExperimentStarted, ProgramDeployed

### Domain-Specific Implementation

1. Journey Domain
   - Core entities: JourneyBlueprint, Phase, Touchpoint, Rule
   - No runtime state (worker progress is in Program domain)
   - Focus on content structure and logic definition

2. Program Domain
   - Core entities: Program, WorkerAssignment, WorkerProgress, FollowUpStrategy
   - Runtime state management for worker interactions
   - Program Execution Engine for managing worker journey state

3. Experiment Domain
   - Two-tier architecture: Journey-level (content) and Program-level (implementation) experiments
   - Cross-cutting concern that spans multiple domains
   - Statistical analysis and variant management

## Clean Architecture / Hexagonal Principles

The Behavioral Coaching Platform implements Clean Architecture principles (also known as Hexagonal Architecture or Ports and Adapters) to maintain separation of concerns and isolate core domain logic from infrastructure details.

### Core Principles Implementation

1. Dependency Rule: Dependencies point inward, with domain logic having no dependencies on infrastructure
   - Domain entities have no imports from external frameworks
   - Application services depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
   - Infrastructure implementations depend on domain interfaces, not vice versa

2. Ports and Adapters Pattern:
   - Primary Ports: Domain service interfaces called by API controllers
   - Primary Adapters: API controllers that translate HTTP requests to domain operations
   - Secondary Ports: Repository and external service interfaces required by domain
   - Secondary Adapters: Concrete implementations of repository and service interfaces

3. Use Case Organization: Business operations are organized around use cases
   - Each significant operation is encapsulated in a dedicated service or handler
   - Use cases define clear input/output data structures independent of delivery mechanism
   - Controllers map API requests to use case inputs and outputs to API responses

### Example Implementation: Journey Domain

```typescript
// Domain Entity (core domain model, no external dependencies)
export class JourneyBlueprint {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  phases: Phase[];
  
  constructor(params: JourneyBlueprintParams) {
    // Initialize entity
  }
  
  addPhase(phase: Phase): void {
    // Domain logic
  }
  
  validateRules(): RuleValidationResult {
    // Domain logic
  }
}

// Port (abstraction required by domain)
export interface JourneyRepository {
  findById(id: string): Promise<JourneyBlueprint | null>;
  save(journey: JourneyBlueprint): Promise<void>;
}

// Application Service (core use case)
export class CreateJourneyService {
  constructor(private journeyRepository: JourneyRepository) {}
  
  async execute(params: CreateJourneyParams): Promise<JourneyResult> {
    const journey = new JourneyBlueprint(params);
    await this.journeyRepository.save(journey);
    return { id: journey.id };
  }
}

// Secondary Adapter (infrastructure implementation)
export class PrismaJourneyRepository implements JourneyRepository {
  constructor(private prisma: PrismaClient) {}
  
  async findById(id: string): Promise<JourneyBlueprint | null> {
    // Infrastructure code using Prisma
  }
  
  async save(journey: JourneyBlueprint): Promise<void> {
    // Infrastructure code using Prisma
  }
}

// Primary Adapter (API controller)
export async function createJourney(req: Request, res: Response) {
  const service = container.resolve(CreateJourneyService);
  const result = await service.execute(req.body);
  res.status(201).json(result);
}
```

### Benefits of This Approach

1. Testability: Domain logic can be tested without infrastructure dependencies
2. Flexibility: Infrastructure implementations can be changed without affecting domain logic
3. Clarity: Clear separation between business rules and technical concerns
4. Maintainability: Changes in one layer don't cascade through the entire system

## Data Model and Relationships

The Behavioral Coaching Platform's data model reflects the complex relationships between the various domains. Here we outline the key entities and their relationships.

### Core Entities and Relationships

1. Organizations
   - Types: Client, Expert
   - Relationships: Has many Users, Workers, Segments, Journeys, Programs
   - Multi-tenant boundary: Each organization is a separate tenant

2. Users
   - Roles: Admin, Training Manager, Program Manager, Content Specialist
   - Relationships: Belongs to Organization, creates/manages content

3. Workers (Audience Members)
   - Attributes: Profile, communication preferences, performance metrics
   - Relationships: Belongs to Organization, assigned to Segments, enrolled in Programs, assigned to Experiment variants

4. Segments
   - Types: Organizational, Location, Performance, Behavioral, Temporal
   - Relationships: Contains Workers, used in Programs, targeted in Experiments

5. Journey Blueprints
   - Structure: Phases, Touchpoints, Rules
   - Relationships: Created by Organization, used in Programs, contains Content, may be shared in Marketplace

6. Programs
   - Attributes: Timeline, objectives, assignment criteria
   - Relationships: Uses Journey Blueprints, enrolls Workers, tracks Progress, may run Experiments

7. Content
   - Types: Text, Rich Media, Interactive, Quizzes, Reflections
   - Relationships: Used in Journey Touchpoints, may have multiple variants for Experiments

8. Experiments
   - Types: Journey-level (content), Program-level (implementation)
   - Relationships: Targets Workers, contains Variants, measures Metrics

### Database Schema Overview

The platform uses PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for data management. The schema includes:

1. Multi-tenant design: `organization_id` as part of primary key or foreign key constraints
2. Soft deletion pattern: `deleted_at` timestamps rather than actual deletion
3. Audit trails: `created_at`, `updated_at`, `created_by`, `updated_by` on critical tables
4. Polymorphic content: Flexible content storage for different content types
5. Experiment tracking: Special tables for variant assignments and metric measurements

- Clean architecture with separation of concerns and dependency inversion
- Multi-tenant design with strong isolation and subscription tier support
- Two-tier experimentation system for content and implementation testing
- Robust WhatsApp integration for effective communication
- Advanced segmentation engine for targeted audience management
- Comprehensive security model protecting sensitive data
- Environment parity across development, testing, and production

This architecture provides a solid foundation that can evolve as the platform grows, potentially transitioning specific domains to microservices when appropriate, while maintaining the cohesion and simplicity benefits of the modular monolith approach.
