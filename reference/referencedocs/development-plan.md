## Development Timeline

This development plan is designed with a logical progression of phases that build upon each other. The plan assumes a team of 4-6 frontend developers working together.

Key milestones include:
- Phase 2 completion: Comprehensive documentation established
- Phase 4 completion: Authentication and core UI components complete
- Phase 8 completion: Worker management and segmentation complete
- Phase 11 completion: Content, Journey, and Program management complete
- Phase 13 completion: Wellbeing features and Projects/Funders complete
- Phase 16 completion: Experiments, Gamification, and Analytics complete
- Phase 19 completion: Marketplace, Admin features, and final polish complete

## Dependencies and Critical Path

The following components represent the critical path for development:
1. Core documentation for consistent development approach
2. Core UI components and layout structure
3. Authentication and user context
4. API client infrastructure
5. Worker and segmentation management
6. Content management system
7. Journey builder interface
8. Program management
9. Analytics dashboards

Early development of documentation, reusable components, and proper API infrastructure will significantly accelerate later phases of development.

## Testing Strategy

Throughout development, the following testing approaches should be used:
- Unit tests for UI components and utility functions
- Integration tests for complex workflows
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- Accessibility testing for all user interfaces
- Performance testing for data-heavy interfaces

## Deployment Strategy

The application should be deployed in phases:
1. Internal development environment (continuous)
2. Staging environment (weekly builds)
3. Production environment (monthly releases)

Continuous integration should be set up to run tests automatically and prevent regressions.
