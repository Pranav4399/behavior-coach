Product Overview: Behavioral Coaching Platform for NGO Frontline Audience v2.0 (SaaS by ABCD)

1. Introduction

The Behavioral Coaching Platform by ABCD (the Atlas of Behavior Change in Development) is a multi-tenant, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution tailored for development organizations of varying sizes and mandates—grassroots NGOs, social enterprises, donor-funded projects, and philanthropic bodies. These organizations rely on frontline audiences—such as field workers, local committee members, students, and more—to drive social initiatives in often challenging, low-resource environments.

By uniting robust audience management, advanced segmentation, flexible training and well-being modules, reminder systems, Journey blueprints, operational Programs, and data-driven experimentation, the platform tackles operational and workforce challenges in a comprehensive manner. While the platform does include a Marketplace that lets Expert Organizations share specialized content or entire "Journey blueprints," this Marketplace is just one part of a broader system. The platform's fundamental purpose is to elevate frontline capacity, motivation, and engagement through evidence-based methods.

These blueprints serve as the foundation for personalized experiences when deployed through Programs.

4.5.1 Journey Architecture and Structure

Journey blueprints are built on:

- Templates: High-level designs defining major objectives and flow.
- Phases: Sequential stages (e.g., Onboarding, Skill Mastery, Reinforcement).
- Touchpoints: Individual interactions, such as a short video, a quiz, or a reflection prompt.
- Paths: Alternate routes if certain conditions are met (e.g., low quiz score, time constraints).
- Exit Points: Mark successful completion or transition points.

Touchpoints can address learning (training materials), assessment (quizzes), action items (field tasks), reflection, or well-being checks, among other possibilities. Each of these elements can include content-level experiments to determine optimal configurations.

4.5.2 Advanced Rules Engine

A robust rules engine defines how interactions should proceed within a Journey:

- Boolean Operations (AND/OR/NOT) and nested logic for branching.
- Threshold Comparisons for quiz scores, performance indices, or stress indicators.
- Fuzzy Logic or weighting for more nuanced conditions.
- Temporal or Location-Based rules (e.g., "start this module if it's the rainy season" or "if the user is physically located in Region X").
- Rule Experimentation: Testing different rule configurations to determine which creates the most effective flow.

4.5.3 External Data Integration

Journey blueprints can incorporate real-time external data to enrich decision logic:

- Weather Services: Define adjustments to field tasks based on weather conditions.
